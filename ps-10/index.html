      The share of births by unmarried immigrant women varies widely by their region
      of birth. Almost half (48%) of U.S. births to women from Latin America happen
      outside of marriage, according to NCHS data â€“ a share higher than the share
      among U.S.-born women (42%). Among foreign-born women from most other regions
      of the world, however, births outside of marriage are less common than among
      U.S.-born women. For example, 26% of babies born to women from sub-Saharan
      Africa were born outside of marriage in 2014. And just 5% of U.S. births to
      women from the Middle East and North Africa are to unmarried women, as are
      about one-in-ten births to immigrant women from elsewhere in North America (11%)
      and Asia (10%). The 38% of births outside of marriage to women from Oceania is
      similar to the share among U.S.-born women.
