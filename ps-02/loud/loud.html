       There is a missing passage in France. Walking along this passage, you would never worry about the traffic jam. Instead, you should worry about how you can find the passage! It is flooded twice a day by the high tide. It hides in the water where it is 4 meters below the sea level.
      Le Passage du Gois ou Gôa is a natural, periodically flooded passage. Length of this track is 4.15 km. This paved-over sandbank leads to the island of Noirmoutier in France. It is located between l'île de Noirmoutier and de Beauvoir-sur-Mer, in the department of Vendée.
      When the passage is passable at low tide, drivers should still be careful. It would even be more dangerous when the passage is wet, and filled with seaweed. Therefore, just like driving on ice, when driving on the wet passage, cars tend to slip. Drivers might drive into sea just for a second of unmindfulness.
      Along the passage, there are a few special traffic signs that could tell drivers if the passage is passable.
     Every year, a foot race – the Foulées du Gois– is held across it, starting at the onset of the high tide.
      However, there are a lot of adventurous tourists who become trapped in the tide. The local departments are already used to this situation and have prepared corresponding measures. The people who are in a dilemma can climb to a rescue tower and wait for the tide to run out, or wait for rescuers.
        Although this passage is really dangerous, the view on the road trip is excellent but not overdone. Plenty of tourists are attracted to this passage to explore the wonderful, interesting and exciting trip.
